The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice. Census counts are necessary to adjust samples to be representative of a population by weighting them as is common in opinion polling. Similarly, stratification requires knowledge of the relative sizes of different population strata which can be derived from census enumerations. In some countries, the census provides the official counts used to apportion the number of elected representatives to regions. In many cases, a carefully chosen random sample can provide more accurate information than attempts to get a population census. A census is often construed as the opposite of a sample as its intent is to count everyone in a population rather than a fraction. As a result of the dangers of a population census, some countries have moved to more expensive and more accurate alternatives, such as the sampling techniques used by the market research industry. \n\n\n\n Provide a background document from Wikipedia to answer the given question. \n\n who is behind the restored church of god? \n\n The Restored Church of God (RCG) is a breakaway group from the Worldwide Church of God (WCG), founded in 1998 by David C.

It is particularly celebrated in Mexico where the day is a public holiday. Prior to Spanish colonization in the 16th century, the celebration took place at the beginning of summer. Gradually, it was associated with October 31, November 1, and November 2 to coincide with the Western Christian triduum of Allhallowtide: All Hallows' Eve, Hallowmas, and All Souls' Day. Traditions connected with the holiday include building private altars called ofrendas, honoring the deceased using calaveras, aztec marigolds, and the favorite foods and beverages of the departed, and visiting graves with these as gifts.

However, some parasites have evolved to become generalists, able to parasitize a wide range of hosts from different taxonomic groups. For example, the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii can infect any warm-blooded animal, including humans, but it can only complete its life cycle in the intestines of cats.\n\nMost parasites are relatively small and simple organisms, such as protozoa, bacteria, and viruses. However, some parasites are large and complex, such as the tapeworms that can grow up to 30 meters in length.\n\nWhile parasites typically cause harm to their hosts, there are some exceptions. For example, the bacteria that live in the gut of termites help them digest cellulose, and without them, the termites would starve. In some cases, parasites can even be beneficial to their hosts, such as when they help them avoid predators or find mates. \n\n\n\n Generate a background document from Wikipedia to support or refute the statement. \n\n Statement: This style of music went lasted many decades with evolution of its style being adapted by different kinds of musicians. \n\nThe history of rock and roll can be traced back to the early 1940s, when the genre emerged in the United States.

It describes a style of popular music that developed from a blend of African-American blues, country, and rhythm and blues. The style is characterized by a heavy backbeat, electric guitars, and a strong emphasis on vocalists. Rock and roll first achieved mainstream popularity in the 1950s, with artists such as Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard. The genre continued to grow in popularity in the 1960s, with bands such as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and the Beach Boys. In the 1970s, rock and roll underwent a major transformation, with the development of punk rock, disco, and heavy metal. These genres were characterized by a more aggressive sound and a focus on youth culture. In the 1980s, rock and roll experienced a resurgence, with the advent of hair metal and alternative rock. In the 1990s and 2000s, rock and roll continued to evolve, with the rise of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. \n\n\n\n Generate a background document from Wikipedia to support or refute the statement. \n\n Statement: {query} \n\n"}
